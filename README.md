# CS300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    During this course we were tasked with learning how to use vectors, Hash Tables, and Binary Search Trees. We also learned when to use them and how to calculate the runtime and     memory of each structure. 
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    I approached the problems by reading and studying the books and other resources. It was a struggle because there is a lot that goes into creating the structures and setting       them up and making them work seemed very overwhelming, however with time and practice I feel that they will make more sense. I think that learning how to use the structures       successfully will be very important because this is how most of the information will be accessed in my future career. 
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    To overcome the roadblocks throughout this course I spent many hours watching youtube and reading different tutorials as well as reading the text book over and over. 
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    After completing this course I had an epiphany. I now see how some of my old code could be improved by including data structures to store information, this will result in a       faster program and much better memory management. 
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    I think this course will completely change the way I write programs. Now that I understand the basics of data structures I will be focusing on how best to use them and             incorporate them into all of my code. This will help with all three areas. The data will be much simpler to maintain because it will all be in the same area of the code. The       readability will be greatly improved because there will be less hard coded information and much more use of parsing other files. Once I have some good structures made I will       be able to start reusing them and upgrading them as needed.
